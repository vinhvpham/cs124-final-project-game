# cs124-final-project-game

Vinh Pham  
Ohlone College  
CS124 - Data Structures  
Fall 2016  

This was an assignment for a lower division data structures course which is a basic game that runs in Windows CMD. The goal of the assignment was to utilize templates, pointers, abstract classes, and Linked Lists in C++ while implementing functions in our game. We were not allowed to use arrays or vectors.


Because of using of certain functions such as `system("cls");`, the game will only work on windows platforms.
